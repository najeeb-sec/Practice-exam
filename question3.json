            "correct": "Create a separate daily backup archive for all applicable tax records. An important consideration for a data retention mandate is to always have access to the information over the proposed time frame. In this example, a daily backup would ensure tax information is constantly archived over a seven year period and could always be retrieved if needed. If data was inadvertently deleted from the primary storage, the backup would still maintain a copy.",

The requirement is to maintain data for at least seven years, but there’s no requirement to remove that data after that time frame. For example, some financial information may need to be retained well beyond the seven year mandate.",
                "B": "Print and store all tax records in a seven-year cycle. Paper has its place, but creating physical output of tax records and storing them for seven years would include a significant cost in time, materials, and inventory space.
